    <<~EOS
      Create a configuration file in your home directory:
        touch ~/.skhdrc

      If you want skhd to be managed by launchd (start automatically upon login):
        skhd --start-service

      When running as a launchd service logs will be found in:
        /tmp/skhd_#{ENV["USER"]}.log

      Note: skhd requires accessibility permissions.
      You'll be prompted to grant these permissions on first run.
