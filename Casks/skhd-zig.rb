    Configuration:
      touch ~/.config/skhd/skhdrc

    Syntax reference:
      https://github.com/jackielii/skhd.zig/blob/main/SYNTAX.md

    Setup (idempotent — safe to re-run anytime):
      skhd --start-service
      # Registers the LaunchAgent and prompts for Accessibility + Input
      # Monitoring on first launch. If your config has .remap / .taphold /
      # fn_layer rules, also prompts (sudo) to install skhd-grabber and the
      # Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice .pkg.
      skhd --status   # verify

    Logs:
      ~/Library/Logs/skhd.log    (agent)
      /var/log/skhd-grabber.log  (grabber, if installed)

    Full teardown of the root grabber (cask uninstall can't sudo):
      sudo skhd --uninstall-grabber

    Migrating from the old formula (one-time):
      brew uninstall skhd-zig      # removes the formula
      brew install skhd-zig        # reinstalls as this cask
  EOS
